# Contributing

1. Branch naming: `feature/<desc>`, `fix/<desc>`.
2. Open PRs against `main`. One approving review required.
3. Run tests locally: `pytest`.
4. Code style: `black`, `isort`. Run `pre-commit install`.
5. CI checks: tests + lint.
6. For AI-generated code: add tests, run lint, and request human review before merging.
